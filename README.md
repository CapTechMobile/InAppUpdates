## README

### This project is a demo of both existing types of In-App Updates, Immediate and Flexible.

It consists of a single activity that can navigate to a different fragment with a menu option.
The menu screen contains the option to update de app, once it has been determined that there is an update ready to be downloaded.

Communication with the user is handled via the Snackbar object, in order to make them aware of the update and to confirm it has been downloaded.

The immediate update is applied without a previous prompt.
